    <h1>1.Quick hummus Recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
     <strong>Hummus is a delicious</strong> thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>
<h3><i>Here Are The List/Recipe</i></h3>
   <ul>
   <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
   <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
   <li> A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul> 
  
    <h1>2.Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
   <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
   <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
   <li> If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>

    <p><i>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</i>
</p>
    <h2>3.Storage</h2>
     Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
